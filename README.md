# Eternity's-Stuff
Some engines and things that I make when I'm bored :p

Hi, I'm Eternity, and I'm pleased to announce that v1.0 of Eternity's Stuff (a very original name) has been released. (My first time making custom parts)

2 new engines added (for now)

RLPE-X4 Methalox Vac Engine. This engine was created in collaboration with zTallsRobot, it's very efficient and its vacuum plume is amazing (I think)

Features:
8t Mass
206t Thrust
306ISP Efficiency

RLPE/X4 Methalox Double Cluster Vac Engine. This engine was also created in collaboration with zTallsRobot.

Features:
24t Mass
520t Thrust
612ISP Efficiency

I hope you like this first version. I'll be updating the .pack soon to have more engines and stuff.
